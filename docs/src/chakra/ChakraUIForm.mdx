# Form built using Chakra UI components

Below is the example how to integrate with Chakra UI.

<br />
There is a custom `<ChakraFormInput />` component which accepts essential form
props, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `error` and `touched` and renders Chakra's input,
label and helper text under the input.
<br />
Alternative way is to use `useConvert` hook to adopt form props to component.

<CodeSamplesLayout
  codeFiles={[
    { name: "ChakraAddressForm.tsx", code: ChakraAddressFormRaw },
    { name: "ChakraFormInput.tsx", code: ChakraFormInputRaw },
  ]}
>
  <ChakraAddressForm />
</CodeSamplesLayout>
