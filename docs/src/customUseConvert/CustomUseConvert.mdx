# Custom useConvert

`useConvert` is used to adopt form props to the form component.
For example [React Date Picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker) wants these essential props

```jsx
selected: Date | null
onChange: (date: Date | null) => void
```

This is where `useConvert` come into play. It accepts `rffFormControl`
and return props suitable to React Date Picker.

<br />
`<Field />` with React Date Picker can be reused in several places in the App,
as `useConvert` is not bound to a specific form.
