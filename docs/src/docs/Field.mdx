# Field

`Field` is a wrapper for frorm field controls.
It gets `value`, `error`, `touched` and `dirty` props from `formControl`
and renders component that is passes in `rffComponent` prop.

```jsx
<Field rffFormControl={formControl} rffName="firstName" rffComponent={Input} />
```

### Props

All props of the `<Field />` start with rff prefix (stands for React Flexible Form).
This is to avoid name conflicts with rffComponent own props that if passed to `<Field />` and will be passed to `rffComponent` when rendering.

- **`rffFormControl`** (Required) is a form control, return value of `useForm`
- **`rffName`** (Required) path to the form prop in dotted notation. Like `obj.field`.
- **`rffComponent`** (Required) component to render.
- **`rffLoadingComponent`** component that is displayed when data is loading
- **`rffDisplayLoading`** function that detects if data is loading to render `rffLoadingComponent`. Default implementation is here
- **`rffUseConvert`** a hook that converts `formControl` to `value`, `error`, `touched`, `onChange` and `onBlur`.
  Default implementation is [here](https://github.com/fyodor-e/react-flexible-form/blob/main/src/field/defaultUseConvert.ts)
  Different components require different props. For example, HTML `<input />` element will require

```jsx
  value: string
  onChange: (event: ChangeEvent) => void
```

But [React Select](https://react-select.com/) has `onChange: (value: Value, ...) => void` so passing it to the `<Field />` will not work, because `onChange` is incompatible.
This is where `rffUseConvert` helps. It is possible to write `onChange` callback specifically for React Select and then just pass custom `useConvert` hook to any `<Field />` that wraps React Select.
