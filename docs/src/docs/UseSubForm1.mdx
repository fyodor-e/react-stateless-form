# useSubform

`useSubform` is a hook to wrap subform. Subform is a collection of form controls but which is used as part of another form.
Example is an address subform. Address subform can be created once and then reused in differenc forms, for example in user details form, order form, warehouse form and so on.
`useSubform` will hide parent form and will return `formControl` compatible with sub form.

```jsx
const subFormControl = useSubform({ formControl, name });
```

For example

```jsx
  type Order = {
    orderNo: number
    warehouse: string
    deliveryAddress: Address
  }

  type Address = {
    city: string
    state: string
    street1: string
    street2: string
    zipCode: string
    country: string
  }
```

`formControl` of the parent form will have type `FormControl<Order>`
and `formControl` of the address subform will have type `FormControl<Address>`.

Validation of the subform should be done at the parent level. For eample, Yup validation for the form above may look like

```jsx
// parentFrom.tsx
import { addressValidator } from "./addressSubform";

const resolver = yupResolver(
  Yup.object({
    orderNo: Yup.number().required("Required"),
    warehouse: Yup.string().required("Required"),
    deliveryAddress: addressValidator,
  }),
);

// addressSubform.tsx
export const addressValidator = Yup.object({
  country: Yup.string().required("Required"),
  state: Yup.string().required("Required"),
  city: Yup.string().required("Required"),
  zipCode: Yup.string().required("Required"),
  street1: Yup.string().required("Required"),
  street2: Yup.string(),
});
```

### Parameters

- **`formControl`** is a result of calling parent's form `useForm`
- **`name`** is a path to any object int the parent's value

### Return value

- **`formControl`** form control of the subform.
