# Overview

The main features of React Stateless Form (RSF for short) are:
* State of the form can be internal (held by RSF) or external (held, for example, in Redux)
* Do not depend on context (althrough it can be used)
* Typesafe as much as possible (it is developed in TypeScript)
* Customizable
* Ability to create Subforms
* Built-in locader components

## Form creation

To create a form [`useForm`](/api/useForm) hook should be called.
At minimum it should have initial values property.
Other common props are:
* `resolver` for validation
* `onSubmit` for form submission
Optionally, `useForm` can be customized. For example, `setFieldValues` can be passed to keep state externally, custom internal hooks, like `useValidate`, etc.
Essentially, `useForm` is a collection of default hooks that implement form functionality.
First, it is checked where form state should be stored. If `setFieldValues`, `setFieldError`, `setFieldTouched` and `setFieldDirty` are not passed, they are created internally.
Then it calls several hooks, `useValidate` to validate the form, `useInitialValues` to set initial values, `useDirty` to calculate if form is dirty and `useSubmitCreator` which create `handleSubmit` function.
At the end, `rsfFormControl` is created be memoizing results of the previous steps.
`rsfFormControl` includes all functions to manipulate a form.


## Field

There is a `Field` component which can be used to wrap any form element, like input or combo.
`Field` accepts at least `rsfFormControl` (see `useForm` above), `rsfName` which is the path to the property of the form, and `rsfComponent` that will display value of the form field.
`Field` will render `rsfComponent` and pass to it a value extracted using `rsfName`.
It also provide default `onChange`, `onBlur` callbacks and `error`.
The problem is that different components need different props.
For example html `<input />` has `onChange: (event: ChangeEvent) => void` and input value will be at `event.target.value`.
But [`ReactSelect`](https://react-select.com/) has such `onChange: (value: SignleValue<T>)`, and `value` is the selected object.
Same will apply how errors should be displayed and so on.
To be able to use `Field` with any library, optional prop [`useConvert`](/api/useConvert) can be used.
It will accept rsfFormControl and rsfName as arguments and should provide momoized `onChange`, `onBlur`, `value` and `error` props. Names of them can be different.
Then `Field` can wrap any component.
See example with custom [`useConvert`](/examples/custom-use-convert).

## Subforms

As all apps are built using reusable components, it can be required to reuse part of the form.
For example, address form can be used in many places: to enter address of the user, address of the building, devivery address and so on.
It can be a good idea to create address form once and the reuse it in several differen forms.
This can be done with [`useSubform`](api/useSubform) hook.
`useSubform` will also generate `rsfFormControl` for use inside subform.
But itself it will accept `rsfFormControl` from parent form and `rsfName` with the path to a value of the
