# useForm

useForm is used to create a `formControl`.
`formControl` is then passed to each `<Field />`
or can be used directly.
It has all methods to change form state (like `setFieldValue`)
and form start itselft (like `values`)

```jsx
  import { useForm } from "react-stateless-form";

  const onSubmit = useCallback(() => { }, [])

  const formControl = useForm({
    initialValues: { firstName: "", lastName: "" },
    onSubmit,
  });
```

### Parameters

* **`initialValues`** (Required)
  * Values to initialize form with.
  * And to compare current values with to detect if field is changed (dirty) or not.
Type of the initialValues will be used to infer `useForm` first type argument
if no other props are passed to `useForm`.
`initialValues` will be memorized only when they are not undefined. This can be used to wait for data from API and when data is loaded set initialValues to that data

* **`onSubmit`** A function that will be called on submission of the form.
  It will receive single argument of object type with two properties:
  `formControl` is what `useForm` will return, but without `handleSubmit` and
  `submitProp` which is optional argument that can be passed to `handleSubmit`.
  `onSubmit` can be async and can optionally return any value that will be return value of `handleSubmit`.
  `submitProp` and return value can be used to communicate with code which calls `handleSubmit` of `formControl`
```jsx
    onSubmit: (arg: {
      rsfFormControl: Omit<FormControl<Values>, "handleSubmit">;
      submitProps: SubmitProps;
    }) => Promise<SubmitReturn> | SubmitReturn
```

* **`resolver`** is used to validate form.
Validation is done by external library [@hookform/resolvers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hookform/resolvers)
Use of this library is optional, it is possible to write resolver manually.

  ```jsx
  type Resolver<Values extends object> = (
    values: Values,
    context: any | undefined,
    options: ResolverOptions,
  ) => Promise<ResolverResult<Values>> | ResolverResult<Values>;

  type ResolverResult<Values extends object> =
    | ResolverSuccess<Values>
    | ResolverError<Values>;

  type ResolverSuccess<Values extends object> = {
    values: Values;
    errors: {};
  };

  type ResolverError<Values extends object> = {
    values: {};
    errors: FormErrors<Values>;
  };
  ```

* **`context?: any`** context which will be passed to resolver. Not used in any other place of the form.
* **`criteriaMode?: "all" | "firstError"`** will be passed to resolver. Not used in any other place of the form.
* **`values?: Values`** values of the form. Values can be passed from outside and they will replace values currently in the form.
Often used with `setFieldValue` to lift state outside of the form to parent component. `values` are not saved by the form and will override user entered values on each render.
For example

  ```jsx
  useForm({
    values: { prop1: 'str' }
  })
  ```
  will make form useless, because user will not be able to change `prop1`. Either memoize `values` or manage form state in parent component and pass `setFieldValue` tigether wilt `values`.

* **`setFieldValue?: SetField<Values>`** function to change `values`. Is used when values are stored outside of the form in parent component.
Arguments: `name` is the field name to change. Empty string ('') can be used to change all values of the form.
`value` is new value or a function `(prevValue: Value) => Value` like in `useState`.
Implementation can be

  ```jsx
  const [values, setValues] = useState<Values>(initialValues)

  const setFieldValue = useCallback((name: any, value: SetterOrValue<any>) => {
    setValues((prev) => {
      const prevValue = getIn({ values: prev, name });
      const newValue = typeof value === "function" ? value(prevValue) : value;
      if (isChanged(prevValue, newValue))
        return setIn({ values: prev, name, value: newValue });
      else return prev;
    });
  }, []);
  ```

* **`errors: FormErrors<Values>`** errors of the form. Used when errors should be stored in parent component.
* **`setFieldError: SetField<FormErrors<Values>>`** errors setter. Works same way as `setFieldValue`

* **`touched: FormTouched<Values>`** touched of the form (which field is touched and which is not). Used when touched should be stored in parent component.
* **`setFieldTouched: SetField<FormTouched<Values>>`** touched setter. Works same way as `setFieldValue`

* **`dirty: FormTouched<Values>`** dirty of the form (which field is dirty and which is not). Used when dirty should be stored in parent component.
* **`setFieldDirty: SetField<FormTouched<Values>>`** dirty setter. Works same way as `setFieldValue`

* **`submitCount?: number`** submit count of the form. Used when submit count should be stored in parent component.
* **`setSubmitCount?: (submitCount: number) => void`** submit count setter. Works same way as `setFieldValue`, but do not allow function in place of value.

* **`isSubmitting?: boolean`** flag which is set when form is currently submitted. Used when submit flag should be stored in parent component.
* **`setIsSubmitting?: (isSubmitting: boolean) => void`** submit flag setter. Works same way as `setFieldValue`, but do not allow function in place of value.

### Parameters to customize form internals

Parameters below are optional and are used to customize how form behave.
* **`useFormSubmitCreator?: UseFormSubmitCreator<Values, SubmitProps, SubmitReturn>;`** is a hook which is used to override default submission process.
Default implementations is [here](https://github.com/fyodor-e/react-stateless-form/blob/main/src/useForm/defaultUseFormSubmitCreator.ts)

  Default submission process is:
  * `formControl.handleSubmit` is called with optional `SubmitProp`
  * All fields are touched
  * resolver is run to validate the form
  * If any errors found, submission stopped
  * If no errors found, `isSubmitting` flag is set
  * `onSubmit` is called with optional `SubmitProp`
  * Return value of `onSubmit` become return value of `handleSubmit`
  And it can be completely overrided with `useFormSubmitCreator`

* **`useValidate`** is a hook to validate the form. It run on each render and sets errors if validation yeilds errors.
It also return `validate` function that is passed to `useFormSubmitCreator`. Default implementation is [here](https://github.com/fyodor-e/react-stateless-form/blob/main/src/useForm/defaultUseValidate.ts)

* **`useDirty`** is a hook to detect if field was changed (dirty). Default implementation is [here](https://github.com/fyodor-e/react-stateless-form/blob/main/src/useForm/defaultUseDirty.ts)

* **`useInitialValues`** is a hook to set initial values of the form. They are used to detect if field become dirty or not and to initializa form.
Default inplementation is [here](https://github.com/fyodor-e/react-stateless-form/blob/main/src/useForm/defaultUseInitialValues.ts)

### Results

`useForm` returns `formControl` object which represents the form.

* **`values: Values`** current values of the form
* **`errors: FormErrors<Values>`** errors of the form.
* **`touched: FormTouched<Values>`** if the field is touched or not (got focus).
* **`errors: FormTouched<Values>`** if the field is dirty (changed).
* **`setFieldValue: (name: Name, value: SetterOrValue<Value>)`** a function to change a value.
If name if empty string - all form values will be changed
`name` is type checked. It should be dot notation of the path.
For example

```jsx
    type Values = {
      firstName: string
      lastName: string
      age: number
      preferences: {
        sendEmail: boolean
        sendSms: boolean
      }
    }
```

    `name` can be `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, `preferences`, `preferences.sendEmail`, `preferences.sendSms` or ''.
    `value` is a value to set or a function `(prev: Value) => Value` (like in React's setState).
    `value` is also typechecked. If `name` is `age`, `value` should be `number` or function returning `number`.

* **`setFieldError: (name: Name, error: SetterOrValue<FormErrors<Value>>)`** errors setter of the form. Behave same way as `setFiledValue`
* **`touched: (name: Name, touched: SetterOrValue<FormTouched<Value>>)`** touched setter of the form. Behave same way as `setFiledValue`
* **`errors: (name: Name, dirty: SetterOrValue<FormDirty<Value>>)`** dirty setter of the form. Behave same way as `setFiledValue`
* **`submitCount: number`** count of submits
* **`isSubmitting: boolean`** flag which is set when form is submitting
* **`handleSubmit`** submit function
