# Form state in Redux

As form state can be stored in parent component it also can be stored in Redux.
It is required to extract `value` and create `setFormValue` function.
Value is extracted from Redux store with `useSelect`

```jsx
const values = useSelector(valuesSelector);
```

`setFieldValue` can be created globally as it only use store.
It is important to not recreate `setFieldValue` function on each `values` change.
