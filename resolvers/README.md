# React Flexible Form Resolvers

React Flexible Form Resolvers is a collection of resolvers.
Resolvers transform errors generated by validation libraries to format that is understood by [React Flexible Form]().
<br />
Currently there is only one resolver for Yup.

### Install

```jsx
 npm i react-flexible-form-resolvers
```

### Usage

```jsx
import { yupResolver } from "react-flexible-form-resolvers";
import { useForm } from "react-flexible-form";

const resolver = yupResolver(
  Yup.object({
    firstName: Yup.string().required("Required"),
    lastName: Yup.string().required("Required"),
  }),
);

const SomeForm = () => {
  const formControl = useForm({
    initialValues: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
    },
    resolver,
    onSubmit,
  });

  return <div>/* Form Controls */</div>;
};
```
